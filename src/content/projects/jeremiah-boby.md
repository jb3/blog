# Why?

I wanted to learn more about humans and how social engineering works, so I
decided to coerce unsuspecting parents into thinking I run a school. Jeremiah,
while roughly 8 years older than me, managed to learn the Art of the Deal quite
quickly under my command.

# What?

The behaviour of other species has fascinated humans for centuries. I, however,
have always been most fascinated by humans themselves and their ability to be
manipulated by me. After realizing that the Ice Cream Man would sell me ice
cream for 5 pennies less if I just _claimed_ I did not have enough money, I
realized that _by making people feel pitiful for me, I can exploit them for my
own good_. It started out similarly with Jeremiah. When his parents brought him
to my "school", he saw in me a pitiful little worm that was "thrown out of
school" and needed help. One thing I've learned: in every game and con there's
always an opponent, and there's always a victim. The trick is to know when
you're the latter, so you can become the former. I mastered this and became his
opponent.

It was the greatest con I've ever pulled. I will explain it. In you, there is
something about yourself, that you don't even know. Something that you will deny
even exists until it's too late to do anything about it. It's the only reason
you get up in the morning, the only reason you suffer the shitty boss, the
blood, the sweat and the tears. This is because you want people to know how
good, attractive, generous, funny, wild and clever you really are. "Fear or
revere me, but please think I'm special." We share an addiction. We're approval
junkies. We're all in it for the slap on the back and the gold watch. The "hip,
hip, hoo-fucking-rah." Look at the clever boy with the badge, polishing his
trophy. Shine on, you crazy diamond. Cos we're just monkeys wrapped in suits,
begging for the approval of others.
