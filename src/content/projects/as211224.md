AS211224 is a small IPv6-only hobbyist network.

# Why?

I wanted to learn more about BGP and how the Internet works, so I decided to get an ASN and some IP space. Since it is a hobbyist network, I opted to just look at IPv6 to keep costs down.

I have run various configurations on this network, using various routers such as BIRD, FRR, OpenBGPD and more. I'm hoping in future to look at getting some physical hardware to run this network on.

# What?

AS211224 is a small network, currently only announcing a /44 and a /48 of IPv6 space (though this is still an immense amount of IPs!).

You can find more information and see the currently announced routes on [bgp.tools](https://bgp.tools/AS211224).

Currently, using Tailscale and some iptables rules, I'm able to browse the IPv6 Internet from my home network over the AS211224 network, which is pretty cool (albeit, the only real benefit is being able to write funny hex jokes in my IP addresses).

# Thanks

Thanks to Connor at [Inferno Communications](https://infernocomms.com/) for providing the IP space and the ASN for this network. I'm looking forward to growing this network and learning more about BGP and networking in general.
