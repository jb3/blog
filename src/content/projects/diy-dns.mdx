My DIY DNS project replaced the nameservers for jb3.dev with self-hosted BIND nameservers deployed using Ansible. It implements advanced DNS features like DNSSEC, including (fairly secure!) automatic key generation.

I'll eventually be writing a full blog post on how I set up this project, from having Ansible install BIND to generating DNSSEC keys and signing the zone.

`core.host.jb3.dev` and `rt1.host.jb3.dev` are the two authorative nameservers for `jb3.dev`, you can try them for yourself using [`dig`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dig).

As an example, a DNS query for this domain, jb3.dev, will start at the DNS roots, progress to the `dev.` TLD nameservers and end up at one of the nameservers that serves the `jb3.dev.` zone. A nicer visualisation of the below dig command can be found [here](https://dns-lookup.jvns.ca/trace.html#jb3.dev).

```shell title="jb3.zone" {31-34} collapse={6-17, 21-24}
$ dig +trace +nodnssec jb3.dev

; <<>> DiG 9.18.27 <<>> +trace +nodnssec jb3.dev

Note: DNSSEC has been omitted here for brevity, but you can see a visualisation of the DNSSEC zones [here](https://dnsviz.net/d/jb3.dev/dnssec/).
