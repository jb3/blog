This page shows what I'm doing currently, if you have your own website, you
[should make your own](https://nownownow.com/about) too.

# Introduction

It's been a while since I last updated this page, a lot has happened in the inbetween!

I graduated from the University of Nottingham with a degree in Computer Science
in July 2025. I've had a nice break over the summer, including a visit to Norway
(highly recommended).

# Python Discord

Python Discord DevOps is still going strong, we've slowed down from rapidly adding
features and moved to a more maintenance mode. We still have a lot of fun
working on it, and I'm still very proud of what we've built.

I spent a lot of time working on the integration of our home-grown SSO solution,
which includes SAML and LDAP support along with an integrated email system.

Most of this activity is still ongoing in our [`infra`](https://github.com/python-discord/infra)
repository if you are interested.

# Owl Corp

Myself, Chris and Johannes have been working on some projects for Owl Corp, our
unincorporated holding zone for various personal projects.

Chris and I have been working on `polonium`, a Discord ModMail bot written to replace
some existing deprecated solutions. It's still in early development, but we're
hoping to have a working version soon.

Johannes and I have been working on a project called [`lithium`](https://github.com/owl-corp/lithium).
We want to create a modern, high-performance mail authentication daemon (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).
Hopefully we will end up with an all-in-one solution as opposed to the current fragmented landscape.

# NSTV & URN

Graduating from University also brought the end of my tenure and involvement with
*University Radio Nottingham* (URN) and *Nottingham Student TV* (NSTV). I had a great time working
with both societies and made some lifelong friends.

I look forward to seeing where the new committees take both societies in the future, and I am ever
thankful for the opportunities afforded to me during my time there. I am also looking forward to
returning in future as an alumnus to help out where I can and deliver training.

Both societies were a cornerstone of my university experience and are an extremely valuable asset
to the University of Nottingham and University of Nottingham Students' Union.

# What's next?

I have an exciting new role lined up to start in December of 2025, which includes a move to London,
nothing to announce publicly yet but keep an eye on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joebanks3/)
for the exciting news soon!
