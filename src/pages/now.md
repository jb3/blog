# Introduction

**Happy New Year :fireworks:!** It's January 2026 as I write this, I'm home for a few weeks and
thought it would be a good time to update this page with what I've been up to recently.

# New Job

In December, I started a new role at the BBC as a Software Engineer in the Media Distribution
Analytics team.

I'm really enjoying the new role so far, working with a great team on some interesting
infrastructure challenges. I'm loving living in London for the first time as well, and our office
at W1A is a great place to work.

There is a (slightly old, but mostly still relevant) blog post about the work that we do in our team
and the kinds of data we work with [on the BBC Digital Archive](https://www.bbc.co.uk/webarchive/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fblogs%2Finternet%2Fentries%2F3f76061d-3db2-4e47-bb9b-712716662a7f).

# FOSDEM 2026

I'll be attending [FOSDEM 2026](https://fosdem.org/2026/) later this month, my first time
at FOSDEM, first time in Brussels and first conference in general for me! I'm looking forward to
meeting up with friends and colleagues, and enjoying what looks to be a great lineup of talks.

If you're attending, please do say hi!

# Python Discord

Python Discord continues strongly, though I've had less time to allocate to it recently
due to starting a new job. However, we have kept things up to date, including mitigating
the recent MongoDB vulnerabilities and sprinkled upgrades elsewhere.

Most of this activity is still ongoing in our [python-discord/infra](https://github.com/python-discord/infra)
repository if you are interested.

# What's next?

I have no concrete plans for the next few months, other than settling into my new role & new city.

If you are London-based and would like to meet up for a coffee or a beer, please do get in touch!
