This page shows what I'm doing currently, if you have your own website, you
[should make your own](https://nownownow.com/about) too.


## Python Discord

Our DevOps team has lately picked back up steam. As part of that, I have
recently implemented a forwarding e-mail server using
[Postfix](https://postfix.org), together with
[postsrsd](https://github.com/roehling/postsrsd) this setup was delightful to
configure.

I have also recently overhauled [our documentation](https://docs.pydis.wtf/),
and we are currently exploring a new concept called "e-mail services". The idea
is that you send an e-mail to specific addresses, and a script on the other end
performs some useful action in response to that. Our first e-mail service will
give you `fortune`s! Send an e-mail to
[fortune@int.pydis.wtf](mailto:fortune@int.pydis.wtf) to test it out.



## Programming

I've recently rebuilt my website with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and it has
been a very pleasant experience, both for the website itself as well as
development. As part of this migration, my website now has a blog, including a
RSS feed, and this very page.
