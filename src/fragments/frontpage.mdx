I'm a Software Engineer based in London, and a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.
In my day job, I maintain large data pipelines at the BBC in the Digital Distribution department.

I work primarily with Python, but also enjoy Elixir and Golang. I also enjoy learning about
the insides of the internet and how it works, and have a particular fondness for DNS and BGP.

I'm a co-founder of <a href="https://pythondiscord.com/">Python Discord</a>, one of the largest
programming communities on the planet with over <span id="pydis-member-count">400,000</span> members.
I also undertake the role of DevOps Lead for the community, maintaining our Kubernetes and Ansible
based infrastructure.

I am the administrator of the hobbyist <a href="/as211224/">AS211224</a> network, a small, IPv6-only
network that I use to play with BGP and other networking technologies.

I'm best contacted via email, at <a href="mailto:joe@jb3.dev">joe@jb3.dev</a>, optionally encrypted with
the below PGP key.
